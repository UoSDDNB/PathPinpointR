#' @title Select Evenly Distributed Switching Genes

#' @descripton Filters switching genes from GenesSwitches to provide you with switching genes which are evenly distributed through pseudotime,
#'     at a selected density.
#'
#' @param sg_allgenes  - Filtered Switching Genes from Gene Switches. (dont use `topnum` instead choose a Psvalue cutoff )
#' @param min_time_spacing - The minimum distance between genes when evenly distributing.
