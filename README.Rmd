# PathPinpointR

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

PathPinpointR identifies the position of a sample upon a trajectory.

##### *Assumptions:*
-   Sample is found upon the chosen trajectory.
-   Sample is from a distinct part of the trajectory. A sample with cells that are evenly distributed across the trajectory will have a predicted location of the centre of the trajectory.


# Example Workflow

This vignette will take you through the basics running PPR.
The data used here is an integrated data-set of blastocyst data.

## Installation

#### Check and install required packages
Run the following code to load all packages neccecary for PPR & this vignette.
```{r}
required_packages <- c("SingleCellExperiment", "Biobase", "fastglm", "ggplot2",
                       "monocle", "plyr", "RColorBrewer", "ggrepel", "ggridges",
                       "gridExtra", "devtools", "mixtools", "Seurat",
                       "parallel", "RColorBrewer")

## for package "fastglm", "ggplot2", "plyr", "RColorBrewer",
# "ggrepel", "ggridges", "gridExtra", "mixtools"
new_packages <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

## for package "SingleCellExperiment", "Biobase", "slingshot".
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
new_packages <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) BiocManager::install(new_packages)

devtools::install_github("SGDDNB/GeneSwitches")
```


#### install PathPinpointR
You can install the development version of PathPinpointR using:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("moi-taiga/PathPinpointR")
```

### Load the required packages
```{r}
library(PathPinpointR)
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(slingshot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(GeneSwitches)
```

## Load the reference data
The reference dataset is a Seurat object of a blastocyst dataset.
```{r}
# download the example data
get_example_data()

# Load the reference data to the environment
seu <- readRDS("./reference.rds")
```

#### View the reference UMAP plot
From the plot we can see that the data shows a clear trajectory.
Tyser21 is the study with the most developed cells, while Petro16 has the least. 
```{r}
DimPlot(object = seu,
        reduction = "umap",
        group.by = "orig.ident",
        label = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Reference")
```
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-reference-dim-plot.png")
```

## Use subsets of the Reprogramming data-set as queries.
As a proxy for an input sample, we can use subsets of the reference data-set.
Here we use Petro16 and Tyser21, the most distant samples on the trajectory.
```{r}
## Take two subsets of the reference to use as samples
sample_names <- c("Petro16", "Tyser21")

# Make an empty list to store the samples
samples_seu <- list()
# Iterate through each sample name, make a list of subsets.
for (sample in sample_names){
  sample_seu <- subset(x = seu, subset = orig.ident %in% sample)
  samples_seu[[sample]] <- sample_seu
}
```

## Convert to SingleCellExperiment objects.
Prior to running slingshot and GeneSwitches, 
we need to convert the Seurat objects to SingleCellExperiment objects.
```{r}
sce    <- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(expdata = seu@assays$RNA$counts))
colData(sce) <- DataFrame(seu@meta.data)
reducedDims(sce)$UMAP <- seu@reductions$umap@cell.embeddings

# create an empty list to to store the sce objects
samples_sce <- list()

#
for (sample_name in names(samples_seu)){
  sample_seu <- samples_seu[[sample_name]]
  # convert each sample to a SingleCellExperiment object
  sample_sce <- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(expdata = sample_seu@assays$RNA$counts))
  # Store the result in the new list
  samples_sce[[sample_name]] <- sample_sce
}
```

## Run slingshot 
Run slingshot on the reference data to produce pseudotime for each cell,
within the trajectory of blastocyst development.
```{r}
sce  <- slingshot(sce,
                  clusterLabels = "seurat_clusters",
                  start.clus  = "2",
                  end.clus = "1",
                  reducedDim = "UMAP")

#Rename the Pseudotime column to work with GeneSwitches
colData(sce)$Pseudotime <- sce$slingPseudotime_1
```

#### Plot the slingshot trajectory.
The plot shows the trajectory of the blastocyst data,
with cells colored by pseudotime.
```{r}
# Generate colors
colors <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(11, "Spectral")[-6])(100)
plotcol <- colors[cut(sce$slingPseudotime_1, breaks = 100)]
# Plot the data
plot(reducedDims(sce)$UMAP, col = plotcol, pch = 16, asp = 1)
lines(SlingshotDataSet(sce), lwd = 2, col = "black")
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-slingshot.png")
```


## Binarize the Gene Expression Data
Using the package [GeneSwitches](https://github.com/SGDDNB/GeneSwitches),
binarize the gene expression data of the reference and query data-sets,
with a cutoff of 1.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# binarize the expression data of sce
sce           <- binarize_exp(sce,
                              fix_cutoff = TRUE,
                              binarize_cutoff = 1,
                              ncores = 4)

# Define a list to store the binarized samples
samples_binarized <- list()
# Iterate through each Seurat object in the list and binarize.
for (sample_name in names(samples_sce)){
  sample_sce <- samples_sce[[sample_name]]
  # binarize the expression data of the sample
  sample_binarized <- binarize_exp(sample_sce,
                                   fix_cutoff = TRUE,
                                   binarize_cutoff = 1,
                                   ncores = 4)
  # Store the result in the new list
  samples_binarized[[sample_name]] <- sample_binarized
}
# Find the swithcing point of each gene in the reference data
sce <- find_switch_logistic_fastglm(sce,
                                    downsample = FALSE,
                                    show_warning = FALSE)

```
Note: both binatize_exp() and find_switch_logistic_fastglm(),
are time consuming processes and may take tens of minutes, or hours, to run.


# **remove this chunk after testing** 
### *(it is only here to save time)*
### Load binarized data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
sample_names <- c("Petro16", "Tyser21")

samples_binarized <- list()
for (sample in sample_names){
  samples_binarized[[sample]] <- readRDS(paste0("../data/binarized_",
                                                sample,
                                                "_sce.rds"))
}
sce <- readRDS("../data/switches_gastglm_blastocyst_reference_sce.rds")
```

## Produce a matrix of switching genes
The switching genes change their expression pattern along the trajectory.

First identify an optimum number of switching genes to include. 
Using the PPR function precision():
```{r}
precision(sce)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-precision1_plot.png")
```

Narrow down your search or you wont find the most opimum r2cutoff.
```{r}
precision(sce, n_sg_range = seq(125, 175, 1))
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-precision2_plot.png")
```


```{r}
switching_genes <- filter_switchgenes(sce,
                                      allgenes = TRUE,
                                      r2cutoff = 0,
                                      topnum = 133)
```
Note: The number of switching genes significantly affects the accuracy of PPR.
  too many will reduce the accuracy by including uninformative genes/noise.
  too few will reduce the accuracy by excluding informative genes.
The PathPinpointR package includes precision() to help you find an optimum.



## Visualise the switching genes
```{r}
# Plot the timeline using plot_timeline_ggplot
plot_timeline_ggplot(switching_genes,
                     timedata = colData(sce)$Pseudotime,
                     txtsize = 3)

```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-switching-genes.png")
```


## Reduce the binarized counts matrices 
As the first step of running PathPinpointR reduce the binarized counts matrices,
to only include the selection of switching genes.
```{r}
# filter the binary counts matricies to only include the switching genes
reference_reduced <- subset_switching_genes(sce, switching_genes)

# Define a list to store the results
samples_reduced <- list()

# Iterate through each Seurat object in the list
for (sample_name in names(samples_binarized)){
  sample_binarized <- samples_binarized[[sample_name]]
  # susbet each sample to only include the switching genes
  sample_reduced <- subset_switching_genes(sample_binarized, switching_genes)
  # Store the result in the new list
  samples_reduced[[sample_name]] <- sample_reduced
}

```

## Predict Position
Produce an estimate for the position of each cell in each sample.
The prediction is stored as a PPR_OBJECT.
```{r}
reference_ppr <- predict_position(reference_reduced, switching_genes)

# Define a list to store the ppr objects of the samples
samples_ppr <- list()
# Iterate through each Seurat object in the predicting their positons,
# on the reference trajectory, using PathPinpointR
for (sample_name in names(samples_reduced)){
  sample_reduced <- samples_reduced[[sample_name]]
  # predict the position of each gene in each cell of the sample
  sample_ppr <- predict_position(sample_reduced, switching_genes)
  #calculate zscore_and_pvalue
  sample_ppr <- zscore_and_pvalue(sce = samples_reduced[[sample_name]],
                                  ppr = sample_ppr,
                                  switching_genes,
                                  cpu = 4)
  # Store the result in the new list
  samples_ppr[[sample_name]] <- sample_ppr
}
```

## Measure accuracy
As our samples are subsets of the reference data-set,
we can calculate the accuracy of the prediction by,
comparing each predicted position to their pseudotimes, as defined by slingshot.

The accuracy varies across the range of pseudotimes, 
generally cells at the centre of the trajectory are more accurately predicted.

```{r}
accuracy_test(reference_ppr, sce, plot = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-accuracy_plot.png")
```

## Plotting the predicted position of each sample:

```{r}
plot_position(samples_ppr[[1]],
              col = "darkgreen",
              overlay = FALSE,
              label = names(samples_ppr)[1])
```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-sample1.png")
```

```{r}
plot_position(samples_ppr[[2]],
              col = "blue",
              overlay = FALSE,
              label = names(samples_ppr)[2])
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/README-sample2.png")
```

## View the Standard Deviation and Z-Score of the predicted positions
As the predicted position is a probablility distribution,
we can view the standard deviation of each samples prediction. 

We can also calcuate a z-score and P-Value of each sample's predicted position.
This is done through comparing the distribution of the predicted position,
to the distribution of 2000 random samples.

```{r}
samples_ppr[[1]]$sd
samples_ppr[[1]]$z_score
samples_ppr[[1]]$p_value
```
